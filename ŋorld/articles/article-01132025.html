				<p><nguh-link href="Heufauna">Heufauna</nguh-link> has narrowly avoided <nguh-link href="Amujxplosion">Amujization</nguh-link> today, as it and the surrounding lands have become part of one whole union.</p>
				<p><nguh-link href="Reborn Amuj">Reborn Amuj</nguh-link> recently split from Heufauna, threatening Amujization. It was immediately considered a disputed ŋation by some, and the Vieŋŋa Conference between <nguh-link href="Kozdenen">Kozdenen</nguh-link>, Heufauna and Reborn Amuj was formed.</p>
				<p>The end result of the Vieŋŋa Conference was that Reborn Amuj became the shortest-lived ŋation in the ŋorld (<nguh-link href="Guiŋŋǝss Ŋorld Records">Guiŋŋǝss Ŋorld Records</nguh-link> says it lasted only 7 hours 55 minutes, from 06:07 <nguh-link href="Time zones">RST</nguh-link> to 14:02 RST), as it became part of the "Amuj Solution". Heufauna, Reborn Amuj, and other surrounding lands merged into the so-called <nguh-link href="CMCic Federation">CMCic Federation</nguh-link>.</p>
				<p>How exactly this new, and hopefully final, result of the incident pessimistically referred to as "the Neo-Amujxplosion" will affect the interŋational community is yet to be determined. However, Rauratoshan's queen regent <nguh-link href="Astaryuu/Nozomi">Nozomi</nguh-link> is cautiously optimistic about it. The Quing officially stated that "while the CMCic Federation is still a bit new, I would support admission [to the <nguh-link href="United Ŋations">United Ŋations</nguh-link>] as an observer."</p>
