				<p>Two weeks ago, <nguh-link href="BurnedCharizard">Jamie Dragin</nguh-link>, set the current ŋorld record for "most deaths in a single month", with 126 "deaths". As stated in that article, dying in Nguhcraft instead teleports one to either their bed or the Spawn Cenrail station.</p>
        <p>However, a new challenger has come to attempt to take this record from Mr. Dragin: Eduard, of the <nguh-link href="CMCic Federation">CMCic Federation</nguh-link>, who died over 80 times in one day. Guiŋŋǝss Ŋorld Records affiliates extrapolated this data and found that if this trend continues, Eduard will experience 2500 deaths in one month, defeating Jamie's record by 1884%. While Ruviyatangan Ŋorld-Herald staff find that result unlikely, as today's deaths were the result of digging a <nguh-link href="Cenrail">Cenrail</nguh-link> tunnel, they do think it'll be likely that Eduard will experience enough deaths to beat the record.</p>
				<br>
				<p>We are watching closely to see if this record is indeed stolen from Rauratoshanian hands, or if Jamie defends their title.</p>
