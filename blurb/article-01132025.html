				<img style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;max-width:230px;border:1px solid #97D9E9;" src="https://hoard.astaryuu.cc/ruviyatangan/img/Heufauna New Map.png">
                <p><a href="https://mc.nguh.org/wiki/Heufauna">Heufauna</a> has narrowly avoided Amujization today, as it and the surrounding lands have become part of one whole union. <a href="https://mc.nguh.org/wiki/Reborn Amuj>Reborn Amuj</a> split from Heufauna, threatening Amujization. It was immediately considered a disputed ŋation by some, and the Vieŋŋa Conference between Kozdenen, Heufauna and Reborn Amuj was formed.</p>
                <p>The end result was that Reborn Amuj became the shortest-lived ŋation in the ŋorld (Guiŋŋǝss World Records says it lasted only 7 hours 55 minutes, from 06:07 RST to 14:02 RST), as it became part of the "Amuj Solution", forming the CMCic Federation.</p>
				<p>How exactly this new, and hopefully final, result of the incident pessimistically referred to as "the Neo-Amujxplosion" will affect the interŋational community is yet to be determined. However, Rauratoshan's queen regent Nozomi is cautiously optimistic about it. The Quing officially stated that "while the CMCic Federation is still a bit new, I would support admission [to the United Ŋations] as an observer."</p>
