				<p><nguh-link href="Port of Eras">The Port of Eras</nguh-link> has completed the <nguh-link href="Cenrail#Crystal Line">Cenrail Crystal Line</nguh-link> recently. It links the 1989 Era to Chillvana through Byelaya Tepe. Between this, the Coastal Line, and the Rails of Eras, the Ruviyatangan Ŋorld-Herald considers the Port of Eras the premier railroad developer of the ŋorld.</p>
				<p>However, there are concerns with this development. Now that the number of interŋational lines has reached 15, the Cenrail color coding system has reached its limit. With only 16 dye colors in Nguhcraft, the Cenrail Corporation has reached an impasse. Any future lines would need to repeat dye colors, which would obviously be not ideal for the accessibility-conscious train service.</p>
                <p>This situation is not without proposed solutions, however. <nguh-link href="Reborn Coldba (Cuba)">Coldba (Cuba)</nguh-link>n officials have expressed a desire to merge the Crystal Line with the Olympic Line, a move popular enough that the Cenrail Corporation's official cartographer, sq, has marked the pending extension on the rail map. Rauratoshanian CEO Hira Ayemânsu is rumored to have suggested creating more dyes, but there is no proof that this suggestion ever reached the interŋational community.</p>
				<p>Rauratoshan's queen regent <nguh-link href="Astaryuu/Nozomi">Nozomi</nguh-link> also suggested that the Archipelago and Aquatic lines be merged. However, this suggestion was deemed to have been made in error, as while the Cenrail map depicts the lines as relatively close together, they are significantly farther apart in reality. In fact, Sta Wejs is further south than Fisete, despite their closeness on the Cenrail map.</p>
